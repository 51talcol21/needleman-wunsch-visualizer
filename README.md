# About

This is my Typescript on React website (tailwind for styling) to showcase the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm with visualization through tables.  

The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is held in it's own script-file and commented in case you want to recreate.

This is mostly to play around and I wanted to learn some bio-informatics while keeping up my CS-knowledge!

# Recreation

To get this website working locally, just clone the repo, cd to the repo, run 
```npm install``` and then ```npm run dev```.
